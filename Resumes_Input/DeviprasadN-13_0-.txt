Project          Adaptive cruise control (ACC) is an intelligent form of cruise control that slows
                 down and speeds up automatically to keep pace with the car in front of you.
                 The driver sets the maximum speed  just as with cruise control  then a
                 radar sensor watches for traffic ahead, locks on to the car in a lane, and
                 instructs the car to stay 2, 3, or 4 seconds behind the person car ahead of it
                 (the driver sets the follow distance, within reason). ACC is now almost always
                 paired with a pre-crash system that alerts you and often begins braking

Position          :   SW development Team member
Period     :          July 2007  Nov 2007
Description       :   The project involves complete testing of communication modules comprising
                      either ABS Only (or) ABS/TC/YSC functionalities. CIM under test receives CAN
                      messages from different ECUs in the Vehicle Network for its operation.
                      Depending on the signal values from received messages the functionality of
                      the CIM can be controlled and tested for its exact operation. Also CIM
                      transmits messages periodically on the CAN bus and these messages
                      indicate the operating state and behavior of the CIM. Testing involves
                      simulating applicable ECU CAN messages, including sensor messages for
                      CIM under test, using Bench wizard and Merlin and verifying, validating that
                      the CIM under test does receive and transmit all functional messages as per
                      the requirements specified in CAN database file (DBC).
