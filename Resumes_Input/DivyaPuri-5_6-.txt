                                                        Recommendations (Reference: LinkedIn)
Sourav Sengupta: HR Manager at ITC Limited (Sourav managed Divya at ITC Limited)
I had the opportunity to mentor Divya during her summer internship with ITC. I found her to be an extremely sharp individual who was very
quick to grasp things with the minimum amount of direction. Her project was complex and involved engagement with several internal and
external stakeholders, and I found that Divya was able to navigate these complexities with ease. Within a period of two months, she was able to
build an excellent rapport with senior managers at the LSTC and thereby gain great perspective on the problem she was attempting to address.
Her final proposal, which was rich in industry insight as well as functional understanding, enabled the R&D leadership to take certain business-
critical decisions on the people front. On the basis of her excellent work and the high level of initiative demonstrated by her, I was glad to
recommend her for a pre-placement offer.
Kuldeep Aima: Director - ITTE at Ericsson India Global Services Ltd (Kuldeep managed Divya indirectly at Ericsson)
Divya is one of the very promising young professionals I have seen. She is very clear about what she wants to achieve and has been successful in
steering her career in that direction. As a fresh engineer out of college she had good concepts and her understand about her subject was
amazing. She quit her exciting career to pursue higher education and was successful in that endeavor too. Other than being an amazing
professional she writes some great blogs, short stories and poems. She is an asset in any team.
Mukesh Sahu: Head of Department, Industry Institute Partnership Cell (Mukesh taught Divya at Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University)
Divya is a very dynamic girl full of energy, she has an excellent ability to manage groups, is very dedicated and hard working. I wish her all the
success in her life to come.
